1. Determine crossover range: [2, 5]
2. Swap within range:
   - child1 = [10, 1, 3, 5, 12, 14, 6, 4, 11, 2, 8, 13, 7, 9]
   - child2 = [10, 11, 4, 12, 5, 9, 8, 3, 1, 14, 13, 7, 6, 2]
3. Create mapping for child1: {3: 5, 5: 3, 2: 2, 12: 12, 14: 14, 6: 6, 4: 4, 11: 11, 8: 8, 13: 13, 7: 7, 9: 9}
4. Check and legalize child1 with mapping:
   - No illegal values found, child1 is already legal.
5. Create mapping for child2: {4: 4, 12: 12, 5: 5, 9: 9, 8: 8, 3: 3, 1: 1, 14: 14, 13: 13, 7: 7, 6: 6, 2: 2}
6. Check and legalize child2 with mapping:
   - No illegal values found, child2 is already legal.

Step 1: Select random crossover range in both 2 parents, avoid the first and last gene.
start, end = sorted(random.sample(range(1, 13), 2))
start=3, end=8
Step 2: Create offspring by exchanging the selected range
child1 = parent1[:start] + parent2[start:end] + parent1[end:]
child2 = parent2[:start] + parent1[start:end] + parent2[end:]
child1=[10, 1, 6, 14, 12, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11, 8, 13, 5, 2]
child2=[13, 10, 3, 1, 6, 4, 8, 7, 12, 9, 2, 11, 5, 14]
Step 3: Determine the mapping relationship to legalize offspring
mapping1 = {parent2[i]: parent1[i] for i in range(start, end)}
mapping2 = {parent1[i]: parent2[i] for i in range(start, end)}
mapping1={14: 3, 3: 12, 12: 6, 6: 14}
mapping2={3: 14, 12: 3, 6: 12, 14: 6}
Step 4: Legalize children with the mapping relationship

<Off2>[13, 1, 14, 3, 6, 4, 7, 9, 11, 8, 2, 12, 10, 5]</Off2>
Explanations:
1. Select random crossover range in both 2 parents, avoid the first and last gene: (start=3, end=11).
2. Create offspring by exchanging the selected range:
- First Offspring (child1): [13, 1, 14, 6, 4, 8, 7, 2, 3, 9, 11, 12, 13, 5]
- Second Offspring (child2): [10, 1, 14, 3, 6, 4, 7, 9, 11, 8, 2, 12, 10, 5]
3. Determine the mapping relationship to legalize offspring:
- First Offspring (child1): (mapping={3: 9, 9: 3})
- Second Offspring (child2): (mapping={3: 3, 9: 9})
4. Legalize children with the mapping relationsip and receive 2 result offsprings as shown.

**Explanation:**
1. Randomly select the crossover range (start, end) in both parents: (start=6, end=10)
2. Create offspring by exchanging the selected range:
    * Offspring 1: [4, 13, 2, 10, 7, **14**, 5, **8**, **9**, 12, 3, 6, 11, 1]
    * Offspring 2: [10, 11, 4, 12, 14, 5, 9, **7**, **13**, 8, 6, **2**, 3, 1]
3. Determine the mapping relationship to legalize offspring:
    * mapping1={14: 8, 8: 14, 9: 7, 7: 9}
    * mapping2={7: 13, 13: 7, 2: 6, 6: 2}
4. Legalize children with the mapping relationship to receive the final offspring traces.
